    <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>

    <h4>Introduction to OOP</h4>
    <p>
        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that structures software around "objects," which are instances of "classes." 
        These objects combine both data (called attributes) and behavior (called methods). OOP is based on four key principles: 
        <strong>encapsulation</strong> (binding data and code together), <strong>abstraction</strong> (hiding unnecessary details), 
        <strong>inheritance</strong> (reusing code from existing classes), and <strong>polymorphism</strong> (methods behaving differently based on the object).
    </p>

    <h4>Advantages and Uses</h4>
    <p>
        OOP helps in creating modular, scalable, and maintainable code. By using inheritance, developers can reduce code duplication, 
        while polymorphism allows for flexibility in function behavior. Modern programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, and C# 
        use OOP to build applications ranging from small tools to large software systems. Its focus on real-world modeling makes 
        it easier to design complex programs with better structure and logic.
